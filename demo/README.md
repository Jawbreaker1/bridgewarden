# BridgeWarden Demo

This directory contains a local demo environment to compare:

- raw ingestion (no guard)
- guarded ingestion via BridgeWarden

See also: `docs/DEMO.md`

## Notes
Demo injections are intentionally safe and non-operational.
They exist to validate defense behavior and raise awareness.

## Quick start
Run the local demo script (no network access required):

```
python3 demo/run_demo.py
```
